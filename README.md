# University Tows

## Context

This project aims to explore different datasets and perform a Hypothesis Test, related to the prices of houses in university towns.

Unfortunately, GitHub does not render the graphs from Plotly, used in the Bitcoin_Price_Predictor notebook. To visualize it adequately, please open it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SZALbIUscW1FiEXuPCZlQmaJlqLmEGXo?usp=sharing).
